STAN Script - Red Team

In our war-game, the attacker is STAN. Equipped with standard Red Team staples, such as Metasploit Framework, along with Caldera. 
Caldera (utilizing the MITRE ATT@CK Model) is not only an autonomous adversary emulation program, but an incredible training environment! 
In which you can complete certain tasks, similar to capture the flag training. 
Once youâ€™ve fulfilled all challenges you can submit your finalization to MITRE and receive official certification of the program, which never hurts. 
The automation of such attack scenerios allows a company's threat detection team to focus more on NEW threats that are on the horizon. 

OUTRO: 
STAN is meant to be utilized as a training enviornment for all. 
Caldera is an open-source free program from Mitre that allows for automated adversarial emulation. 
STAN is also meant to be fun! 
So, GO KILL KENNY!
