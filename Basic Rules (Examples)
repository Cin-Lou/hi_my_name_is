Here are some basic rules of engagement in case you need a bit of assistance with your first game:

Rule #1- Limit History command
    -This is mostly for a bit of control in looking back from previous commands. There is a point where this could potentially be flexible, but it will be up to your game master 
     for when and where this can be implemented.
Rule #2- No contact with the opposite team
    -Very simple! This should prevent any unneccessary information leaking outside of the game
Rule #3- Have FUN!
    -No, seriously, have fun!
