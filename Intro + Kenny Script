                              Kenny Box

-The Kenny Box acts as the median target for both sides and is the main machine for team on team interaction.
-By following scenarios and purposely opening ports during engagements the Kenny box can act as a "real life" counter-part to what we face from a adversarial and 
  friendly point of view.
-To help illustrate this more, Kenny comes equipped with a program called GHOSTS.
-GHOSTS is a framework built by Carnegie Mellon University for the purpose of NPC automation on a live network.
-With this automation network traffic is simulated through a multitude of python scripts to give realistic training of what people might do on the networks we are defending 
  (from creating documents, access systems, browsing the web, running commands, etc).


                              Intro
                              
-Hello, viewers! My name is Curtis Spearman and I would like to formally introduce you to our 2010-cohort project-STAN
  (created by Cynthia Davis, Stephen Reyes, and myself).
-What is STAN? STAN stands for: SHORT-TERM-ATTACK-NETWORK
-It is a wargame/training environment created for practical network compromising and defending.
-This purple-team style environment allows for two sides to act out a specified goal and generate a simulated response to 
  prepare cyber-professionals for the incidents they will face.
-Whether your pentesting email servers, unleashing RATs, or mock responses to cyber-incidents, STAN allows for this training to take place in a controlled sandbox 
  with the trainers determining the ride.
-So how does it work?
-STAN can be broken in three components:
  A Red-Team focused Kali VM named STAN, Can Be Made Vulnerable Kali VM named Kenny, and a Blue-Team focused Kali Vm named Dre
-These three components act as the centerpiece of any scenario or live engagements that can take place.
-Each box also comes equipped with a unique feature to help individualize and improve user experience for additional learning.
-This makes it so that group training, as well as single person training, can access any box and have all learning tools available for use.
-This is accomplished through the use of two very important tools: CALDERA and GHOSTS.
