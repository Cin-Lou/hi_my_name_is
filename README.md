Short-Term Attack Network
via Cynthia, Curtis and Stephen, respectfully.


**STAN**, (for Short Term Attack Network), is a wargame/training environment created for practical network compromising and defending. This purple-team style environment allows for two sides to act-out a specified goal and generate a simulated response to help prepare cyber-professionals for the incidents they may face. Be it compromising email servers, unleashing RATs, or even complete retrieval of private information, STAN allows for this training to take place in a controlled sandbox with the group determining the ride.
